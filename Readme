# MakeCfgFile – Polycom Config Generator

This PowerShell script (`Make-PolycomCfg.ps1`) automates creating Polycom **SoundPoint IP** phone configuration files from a CSV input.

---

## What it does
- Reads a CSV containing phone extension and credential details.  
- For each row, generates a `<MAC>_phone.cfg` XML file in the correct Polycom SoundPoint format.  
- Each file includes:
  - SIP registration info (extension, auth ID, auth password, server/port/transport)  
  - Voicemail callback settings  
  - SNTP time settings  
- Optionally writes a `000000000000.cfg` **master config** that tells each phone to fetch its own `<MAC>_phone.cfg`.  

These files can then be placed in the 3CX provisioning folder (or any HTTP/HTTPS server) so phones auto-provision on boot.

---

## CSV format
The CSV must include these column headers:

MAC,EXT,AUTH_ID,AUTH_PASSWORD,LABEL,SERVER,PORT,TRANSPORT

- **MAC**: Phone’s MAC address (12 hex digits, no separators)  
- **EXT**: Extension number (e.g., `220`)  
- **AUTH_ID**: SIP Authentication ID (from 3CX extension settings)  
- **AUTH_PASSWORD**: SIP Authentication Password (from 3CX extension settings)  
- **LABEL**: Display label shown on the phone screen  
- **SERVER**: Registrar FQDN or IP (e.g., `deez.3cx.com.au`)  
- **PORT**: SIP port (usually `5060`)  
- **TRANSPORT**: SIP transport (usually `UDP`; can be `TCP` or `TLS` if needed)  

If a label contains spaces, wrap it in quotes. Example: `"Staff Room"`

## Example CSV (`csvExample.csv`)

```csv
MAC,EXT,AUTH_ID,AUTH_PASSWORD,LABEL,SERVER,PORT,TRANSPORT
0004F24EC2C4,220,220,SeCr3tP@ss,"Catherine Brunt",deez.3cx.com.au,5060,UDP
0004F24F6F0F,221,221,AnotherPass,"Staff Room",deez.3cx.com.au,5060,UDP

.\Make-PolycomCfg.ps1 -CsvPath "C:\path\to\csvExample.csv" `
  -OutDir "C:\ProgramData\3CX\Instance1\Data\Http\Interface\provisioning\<token>" `
  -WriteMaster

	•	-CsvPath: Path to your input CSV
	•	-OutDir: Destination folder for generated config files
	•	-WriteMaster: Also creates the master 000000000000.cfg file

After running, each phone will have a matching <MAC>_phone.cfg file ready to serve.

Using with non-Polycom phones

This script is designed around Polycom SoundPoint XML config format.

If you need to generate configs for other brands (e.g., Yealink, Fanvil, Snom):
	1.	Export or download a working .cfg file from an existing phone of that brand
	2.	Use its format as a reference (syntax, tags, attributes)
	3.	Modify the New-PolycomPhoneCfg function in this script to output that format instead

This allows you to keep using the same CSV structure while generating vendor-specific configuration files.
